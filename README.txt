# BikeInventorySql.py 
# A quick overview:
# NOTE this app is still being fine tuned. Also I relize that the sqlite3 isnt the best sql 'wrapper' however being that it can be use on a singel local machine and a package that comes with python3 I was the best one for me. this app uses the os lib and it is not recomended to use in the idle


# The bike inventory system would be used to keep track of bicycles.
# At my current job their is no way of tracking bikes with serial numbers and tag numbers there is only a part number and quantity.
# Alternitivly BikeInventoryV1_0.py could be used with cars and their vin numbers withe some slight alterations.

# How to use.

# 1) when opening the program you will need to go into the master menu and set up a .db file which will record and save all your bikes.
#    the .db file is made in the same directory the app is on.

# 2) then you can move on an use the app

#   2a option 1 Wearhouse allows you to add bikes into you database
#   2b option 2 Sales allows you to take the bikes from your database and moves to a "list to be sold"
#   2c option 3 Tech informs the bike tech to pull xyz bike from "list to be sold"

# usually in this order.
